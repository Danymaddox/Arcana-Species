# Arcana-Species
Official Github for my Resource Packs.

Here you can add issues or suggestions for all of my ResourcePacks. Yes, this repository is named Arcana Species like my main RP, but here you can post anything related to any of my resource creations, and it's linked in any of my Modrinth official projects. 

Please make sure to include in the title of the Issue/Suggestion the ResourcePack related, and provide images if possible.

Thank you for downloading, reading and help me improve my packs <3
