# Arcana Species Changelog

## Future implementations / Important notes

- 1-20+ Support. No more delaying updating to newer versions.
- I'm now focusing on adding all tweaks related to the modpacks im working/playing. If you like to have any mod added, please use GitHub to create a suggestion. I will add it eventually, but take in consideration that larger mods takes much more time.

Please report any bug here: [GitHub](https://github.com/Danymaddox/Arcana-Species/issues).

## Version 1.1

<summary>Spoiler</summary>

### Added

- Custom Dark-Golden Theme (DGT) to Minecraft Vanilla GUI's (mod support will be added soon).
- Nature's Compass (Renamed to Naturae Abitium) textures.
- ItemLocks mod textures are slightly darker and transparent.
- Cyan Unobtanium Block.
- Modular Routers Retexture.
- MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod mail texture.
- Tons of DGT supports added

### DGT mod support

Note: This will probably get some golden touches to buttons and misc, but I need more time to test where to put them. I apreciate any [suggestions/ideas](https://github.com/Danymaddox/Arcana-Species/issues).

### Known bugs/problems.

- Any non-supported GUI will have problems rendering texts since with this pack all text in GUIS are changed to a white-greysh color. This is usually just a visual problem, but with some mods it can be specifically problematic. For example: Mana and Artifice Codex Arcana. Please report any mods that do not render text properly so I can fix them as soon as possible.
