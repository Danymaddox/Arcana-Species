## Future implementations / Important notes

- 1-20+ Support. No more delaying updating to newer versions.

### Changed

### Removed/Deprecated

- Any and all textures that do not work on modern MC versions.
- The Vault mod textures had been removed due to Iskall's behaviour.
- ISpawners textures had been Removed due to Iskall's behaviour.
- VaultarHUD DGT support has been removed since there's no support for any Vault Hunters textures.

### Fixed

- A stupid amount of texture inconsistencies.
- Buttons not working properly.
- Smithing text.
- Tooltips not working.
- ExtremeSoundMuffler inventory texture.
- Curios Textures.
- JEI textures.
- Curios Textures for newer versions. Old ones should still be supported.

### Known bugs/problems.

- Any non-supported GUI will have problems rendering texts since with this pack all text in GUIS are changed to a white-greysh color. This is usually just a visual problem, but with some mods it can be specifically problematic. For example: Mana and Artifice Codex Arcana. Please report any mods that do not render text properly so I can fix them as soon as possible.

### To do list

- Fix text color. In most UI's color is defined by the modder, but in some cases (MnA Codex Arcana), its defined by core shaders. Either I need to also darken those GUI's or find a way (if there is one) to change the color back to black when using the Codex Arcana.
- Yellow items to goldish items.
- Search text and tooltip text to gray DGT, Crafting table phantom item in recipes (red --> purple)
- Add fusion support, both 'bleeding' textures and emmisive ores (will be a separate file).
- Update AE2 textures to new version. This is going to be a pain tbh.
- Update/Add MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod: Refurbished DGT Support.

- Fantasy's Furniture --> Not in 1.21 needs testing
