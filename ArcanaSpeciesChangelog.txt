# Arcana Species Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Future implementations / Important notes

- 1.20+ Support is on hold for now. Will take a lot of time to split GUI and HUD assets and now I want to focus on creating the basics of the Resource Pack and later (probably when I start focus on playing newer versions) I'll start updating.
- I'm now focusing on adding all tweaks related to VaultHunters3 modpack, including all GUIs from mods aswell as some re-colors. As soon as I finish this I will probably start porting to 1.20 and/or, if VaultHunters4 is ready to play, start adding new mods to the texture pack compat.
- If possible, add customizations for my patreons/twitch subscribers. This is not a priority at the moment, since Im pretty sure I need to learn Java Coding in order to make this possible.

## Version 1.1

- Custom Dark-Golden Theme (DGT) to Minecraft Vanilla GUI's (mod support will be added soon).
- Gold coins from The Vault are now more golden.
- Nature's Compass (Naturae Abitium) textures.
- ItemLocks mod textures are slightly darker and transparent.
- Cyan Unobtanium Block.
- Modular Routers Retexture.
- MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod mail texture.

### DGT mod support

Note: This will probably get some golden touches to buttons and misc, but I need more time to test where to put them. I apreciate any suggestions/ideas.

- Architects Pallete.
- Botania.
- Curios.
- ExtremeSoundMuffler.
- Mc Furnitures.
